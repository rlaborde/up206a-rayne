# LIVING LANDSCAPES: Exploring the Relationship between LA Parks and Encampments

[Project Proposal](https://github.com/rlaborde/up206a-rayne/tree/main/up206a%20Project)

**Status Update** 
I spend most of my time completely amazed that any of this is possible and so accessible, even though the problem solving struggle is real. My biggest barrier is still not knowing how to phrase what I want to ask/do in order to be able to search for similar work, questions, and tutorials - but I am getting better at interpreting error messages! I do spend a possibly unsustainable amount of time

**Data Update**
Right now, I'm wondering if I need to pull some data into Stata to test for significant relationships, or if there is a way to do this in Python?
Report on the general mood of the team, and provide details as to what is working, and what is not.
Data update: Provide a short narrative on where you are with the data sources you will incorporate in your project. Provide links as necessary.
Concerns: There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."
