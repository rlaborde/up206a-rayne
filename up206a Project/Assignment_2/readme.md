# Assignment 2: Encampment Service Request Frequency in LA County Census Tracts
Grouping LA 311 Encampment Service Requests by Census Tracts creates the opportunity to compare service request frequency with area factors including race, median income, and rent burden to examine correlation. Note: My partner dropped this week and I spent a significant amount of time figuring out other data analysis methods on my encampment and parks geographies, like buffers, so for this assignment I stuck to the minimum amount of work. I also included my notebook for park geometry with buffers in this folder as it shows where I concentrated my effort, and I look forward to brining the explorations in these two notebooks together for a much richer analysis!
