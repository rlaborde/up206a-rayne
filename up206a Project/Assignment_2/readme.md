# Assignment 2: Encampment Service Request Frequency in LA County Census TractsÂ¶
Grouping LA 311 Encampment Service Requests by Census Tracts creates the opportunity to compare service request frequency with area factors including race, median income, and rent burden to examine correlation. Note: My partner dropped this week and I spent a significant amount of time figuring out other data analysis methods on my encampment and parks geographies, like buffers, so for this assignment I stuck to the minimum amount of work. I also included my notebook for park geometry with buffers in this folder as it shows where I concentrated my effort, and I look forward to brining the explorations in these two notebooks together for a much richer analysis!

Create a Jupyter Notebook and use pandas to explore and visualize the data
Produce several charts, including one or more maps
Make sure to document each procedure with markdown cells with relevant headers
Run the cells in the notebook, and make sure the notebook "reads" from top to bottom, telling a story
At the end of the notebook, include a markdown cell that identifies each member of the group and describes their contribution to this assignment (one sentence each)
Upload the Jupyter Notebook to your group repo
