# LIVING LANDSCAPES: Exploring the Relationship between LA Parks and Encampments
**Rayne Laborde**

*Research Question:* What are the shared characteristics of City of Los Angeles Public Parks where encampments occur?

*Research Impact:* This question addresses is directly relevant to my's Capstone on how reimagining the role of parks in communities can better serve unhoused populations. Broadly, better understanding park-based encampments helps clarify certain needs of unhoused individuals, patterns of settlement, and can identify key areas for further services or new initiatives. 

*Spatial Scope:* I will be looking at parks and unhoused settlements in the City of Los Angeles. This narrows my scope to one jurisdictional area, which I will study over the 2016-20 period in order to understand which park-based informal settlements are persisting over time.

*Data Sources:*  I will use the [LA 311 service requests database](https://data.lacity.org/A-Well-Run-City/MyLA311-Service-Request-Data-2020/rq3b-xjk8) from years 2016-20 to determine encampment sites, and a [City of LA Parks shapefile](https://data.lacity.org/A-Livable-and-Sustainable-City/Department-of-Recreation-and-Parks-GIS-Map-of-Park/nuub-r4zx) to determine where these coincide with park spaces. Further data sources may include transit adjacency, data mapping restrooms and/or water access, adjacent parking, American Community Survey demographic data, and/or programmatic survice provision.

*Scope:* My project seeks to understand the relationship between park services, location, demographic context, and occurance of encampments. Visualizations will include a map of changes in park-based encampment locations over time (2016-20); a map of persistent park-based encampments throughout the time period; a chart showing correlation between park-based services and encampment occurance; a chart showing correlation between park characteristics and encampment occurace; and a map of neighborhood demographics adjacent to occupied park areas.

*Anticipated Insights:* Some hypotheses include: larger parks with greater amenities will host encampments more often than smaller parks; similarly, parks in socioeconomically marginalized communities will host encampments more often; transit-adjacent parks may host a greater number of encampments than parks in transit deserts.
