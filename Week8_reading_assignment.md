# Week 8 Reading Assignment
*"Global Trends Toward Urban Street Network Sprawl," Christopher Barrington-Leigh & Adam Millard-Ball*

In architecture, we often think in terms of grids as a funamental organizing principle and measure of efficiency - so while overwhelming, it is in some ways not surprising to consider how an overall urban grid drives (or, as it were, contains) urban sprawl and can be an essential metric to considering nation-wide development patterns. However, as someone without a transportation studies background, I am less familiar with the assumption that regularly gridded streets are more bikeable and associated with a greater prevalence of public transit, which is interesting. This raises a question of connectivity via vehicular travel vs pedestrian travel, which have different needs and design expectations. Given the reserach implications, I am curious if the authors would recommend future development patterns follow only connected, regular grids, or if there is more of a "sweet spot" that denies uniformity while maintaining strategic efficiency?

1. While this study is very revealing in terms of international development trends and broad indicators, I'm curious how local specificity could become a foil - either a productive one or an impediment. I think of how connectivity doesn't necessarily translate to usability, an inherent jobs/living balance, accessibility (in terms of street paving quality or width, which I see another of your studies addresses), road diets, etc etc... Where do you see the limits of this research?

2. In terms of the city-level trends analysis, what about highly connected (in terms of walkability) but potentially broken and certainly irregular grid pre-car urban centers? Are these propotionally small enough to not influence results, or are they otherwise accounted for?
