# up206a-rayne

<i><b>Hello! I'm Rayne, a fourth year M.Arch I/MURP concurrent degree student and a Research Fellow at cityLAB-UCLA.</b> My research focuses on affordable housing, community-engaged design and research processes, and creating inclusive public spaces for users of all ages. When I'm not drawing or editing, I enjoy making rugs, roller skating, and proving that some people do, in fact, walk in LA.</i>

<b>This repository is home to my work for UP206A, a master's course in spatial data science.</b> I am interested in investigating housing conditions in Florence-Firestone, mapping relationships between density of unhoused Angelenos and City parks, and considering spatial and environmental factors which could contribute a new system of typologizing LA parks. In this course, I hope to learn a variety of new software, build my confidence in tackling new forms of image making and data sorting, and learn to make interactive, easily editable, highly accessible web maps.
