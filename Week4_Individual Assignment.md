# Humanitarian Mapathon
For the Humanitiarian Mapathon, I digitized 303 buildings in South Sudan's Kaya Refugee Camp (and briefly made it to my lucky number 14 on the leaderboard). Even though I simply stumbled into this as one of 4 mapping options, being able to contribute to this particular effort was very humbling. For almost a decade my life goal was to work in human rights (specifically designing refugee camps) in Darfur, Sudan. Eventually going to college, working in human rights, and learning about white saviorism and colonialism re-centered my priorities much closer to home. To have come full circle and be able to do something small but meaningful thanks to the skills I've learned as an architect and urban planner, something which stands to benefit the local work South Sudanese data scientists and researchers, was very moving. The Mapathon is a wonderful effort; I loved the energy on Slack and the tutorials were very easy to follow. I've always been annoyed to find messy or improperly located buildings when pulling files for architecture (and a lot that don't use the magical Q tool), so now that I know how to trace and correct buildings, I predict much more of it in my future!
