In “Homelessness in Portland, Oregon: An Analysis of Homeless Campsite Spatial Patterns and Spatial Relationships,” Krystle N. Harrell seeks to understand where homeless individuals seek temporary shelter across the city of Portland in order to inform new policies for engagement and support. Harrell argues that many current methods of homeless count “aggregation [do] not allow for in-depth analysis of homeless spatial patterns within a region, which is crucial to understanding local variations, or similarities.” Therefore, her research provides granular locational analysis of both campsites and specific urban features, like supportive services and transportation. Key research questions include 1. Where homeless campsites tend to cluster in the city of Portland, 2. How these clusters relate to urban features, and 3. What sub-neighborhood patterns of homeless spatial preferences can be identified.

To me, this research approach stands out as an exemplary model because of how clearly Harrell is able to then illustrate significant relationships between a particular Zoning Category, distance, transit stop, and encampment clustering, which Harrell then translates to potential sites for clustering service provisions. The visual impact of the data alone forms a clear, persuasive argument, and paired with her chosen datasets she is able to make strong arguments without an overwhelming amount of details or subcategories - which is something I struggle with given the growing amount of detailed datasets readily available! As such, her research is able to inform granular policy (exact placement of services) and larger-scale network analysis understanding. Finally, she forms a replicable model for researchers in other cities. For instance, it would be interesting to see if multi-nodal and sprawling LA has similar camp concentrations to Portland, where 94.91% of campsites are observed in mixed-use residential and commercial zones, and 58.49% are within a ¼ mile of rail stops.
