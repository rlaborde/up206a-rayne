# Week 3 Reading Assignment

As a joint urban planner/architect, I spend a lot of time mapping and drawing street grids - my thesis was actually citied where the Spanish/Colonial Ord and Jeffersonian Grids meet here in LA. Yet, despite a strong familiarity with Lynch's views on grids and qualitative data, I had never given much thought to the efficiency of these grids, beyond the efficiency of repetition. Seeing that efficiency classified and broken down into such specific attributes was an incredible way to understand how seemingly simple topics can become deep wells of data analysis that reveal more about our cities and our ways of living. 

One thing in particular that I am quickly growing to love about this world of spatial we are stepping into is the prevalence of open source. While economists, social scientists, and others share their methodologies in journal articles, often including very detailed formulas and caveats, they do not share their data. To reach the end of an article and find both code examples and a data repository is remarkable - a whole new level of citing your sources!

### Questions
*1. One of the huge benefits of learning this software is rapidly generating detailed maps. But of course as we know they aren't always correct, or provide differing levels of detail to what someone using these for an applied project may want. Do you see a future where it would be possible to build a detailed, layered map in Python, then download as vectors to edit in a software like Rhino or CAD, and re-upload? This would be invaluable for architects and urban designers...*

*2. In the OSMnx article, the issue of some parking lots being classified as alleys, etc in shapefiles came up - I have frequently experienced this with driveways in both residential and commercial areas. Under your methodology, do these get algorithmically sorted or otherwise accounted for? Is there a theory why this misidentification is so common?*
